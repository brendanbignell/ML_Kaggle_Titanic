# ML_Kaggle_Titanic

## Why

The main reason for doing this is to compare building an ML model in C#/.NET vs Python.

## Overview

This is a project to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. 

The dataset is from Kaggle and the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not. 
The dataset contains 891 rows and 12 columns.

Comparison of LightGBM and FastTree and a deep learning ensemble model consisting of:
	SDCA Logistic Regression
	FastForest
	LBFGS Logistic Regression

Usage of Nvidia GPU for training also tested although on this trivial ammount of data it is not needed.
